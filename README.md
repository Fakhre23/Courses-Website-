The project is a web-based **Course Management System** that allows users to add and view course details. Users can input course information such as the course name, short name, description, start date, and end date, which is then stored in a database. After submission, a notification confirms whether the course was successfully added.

Courses are displayed in a list where users can click on a course name to view its detailed information, including a description, important dates, and a course image. The layout is designed using HTML and CSS, with a grid system to neatly organize content. The design is responsive, ensuring proper display across various devices.

The project relies on a database to store and manage course data, with PHP handling the back-end logic for database interactions. Each course's information is fetched and presented dynamically from the database. The overall system offers a simple yet efficient way to manage courses through an easy-to-navigate interface.
